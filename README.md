## Morning Page is based on Julia Cameron's ['Morning Page'](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/)
### To-do
1. Correct login behavior.
1. Figure out how to beautifully display word frequency chart (d3, perhaps)
1. Decide whether to allow users to see past entries (an obvious feature, but doesn't necessarily align with the philosophy of morning pages.)
